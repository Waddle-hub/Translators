### DEFINITIONS TO TRANSLATE
 

## software engineering ->

 Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering approaches to the development of software. Software engineering is a sub-field of computing science.

## Software Design ->

 Software design is the process by which an agent creates a specification of a software artifact, intended to accomplish goals, using a set of primitive components and subject to constraints. Software design may refer to either "all the activity involved in conceptualizing, framing, implementing, commissioning, and ultimately modifying complex systems" or "the activity following requirements specification and before programming, as ... [in] a stylized software engineering process."

## Machine Code ->

 Machine code is a computer program written in machine language instructions that can be executed directly by a computer's central processing unit (CPU). Each instruction causes the CPU to perform a very specific task, such as a load, a store, a jump, or an arithmetic logic unit (ALU) operation on one or more units of data in the CPU's registers or memory.

## OOP ->

 Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data, in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties), and code, in the form of procedures (often known as methods). A feature of objects is an object's procedures that can access and often modify the data fields of the object with which they are associated (objects have a notion of "this" or "self"). In OOP, computer programs are designed by making them out of objects that interact with one another.[1][2] OOP languages are diverse, but the most popular ones are class-based, meaning that objects are instances of classes, which also determine their types.

## Indirection ->

 In computer programming, indirection (also called dereferencing) is the ability to reference something using a name, reference, or container instead of the value itself. The most common form of indirection is the act of manipulating a value through its memory address.

## Software reuse -> 
 
 Code reuse, also called software reuse, is the use of existing software, or software knowledge, to build new software, following the reusability principles.

## Components and SoftWare reuse ->
 
 Component-based software engineering (CBSE), also called components-based development (CBD), is a branch of software engineering that emphasizes the separation of concerns with respect to the wide-ranging functionality available throughout a given software system. It is a reuse-based approach to defining, implementing and composing loosely coupled independent components into systems. This practice aims to bring about an equally wide-ranging degree of benefits in both the short-term and the long-term for the software itself and for organizations that sponsor such software.

## Pattern Languages of Programming ->
 
 Pattern Languages of Programs is the name of a group of annual conferences sponsored by The Hillside Group. The purpose of these conferences is to develop and refine the art of software design patterns. Most of the effort focuses on developing a textual presentation of a pattern such that it becomes easy to understand and apply. This is typically done in a writers' workshop setting.

## Creational Design Patterns ->
 
 In software engineering, creational design patterns are design patterns that deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation. The basic form of object creation could result in design problems or in added complexity to the design. Creational design patterns solve this problem by somehow controlling this object creation.

## Structual Patterns ->
 
 In software engineering, structural design patterns are design patterns that ease the design by identifying a simple way to realize relationships among entities.

  Examples of Structural Patterns include:

  Adapter pattern: 'adapts' one interface for a class into one that a client expects

  Adapter pipeline: Use multiple adapters for debugging purposes.

  Retrofit Interface Pattern: An adapter used as a new interface for multiple classes at the same time.

  Aggregate pattern: a version of the Composite pattern with methods for aggregation of children

  Bridge pattern: decouple an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently

  Tombstone: An intermediate "lookup" object contains the real location of an object.

  Composite pattern: a tree structure of objects where every object has the same interface

  Decorator pattern: add additional functionality to an object at runtime where subclassing would result in an exponential rise of new classes

  Extensibility pattern: a.k.a. Framework - hide complex code behind a simple interface

  Facade pattern: create a simplified interface of an existing interface to ease usage for common tasks

  Flyweight pattern: a large quantity of objects share a common properties object to save space

  Marker pattern: an empty interface to associate metadata with a class.
  
  Pipes and filters: a chain of processes where the output of each process is the input of the next

  Opaque pointer: a pointer to an undeclared or private type, to hide implementation details
 
  Proxy pattern: a class functioning as an interface to another thing 

## Behavioral Patterns
   In software engineering, behavioral design patterns are design patterns that identify common communication patterns among objects and realize these patterns. By doing so, these patterns increase flexibility in carrying out this communication.

   Examples of this type of design pattern include:

   Blackboard design pattern: provides a computational framework for the design and implementation of systems that integrate large and diverse specialized modules, and implement complex, non-deterministic control strategies

   Chain of responsibility pattern: Command objects are handled or passed on to other objects by logic-containing processing objects
   Command pattern: Command objects encapsulate an action and its parameters

   "Externalize the stack": Turn a recursive function into an iterative one that uses a stack

   Interpreter pattern: Implement a specialized computer language to rapidly solve a specific set of problems

   Iterator pattern: Iterators are used to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation

   Mediator pattern: Provides a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem

   Memento pattern: Provides the ability to restore an object to its previous state (rollback)

   Null object pattern: Designed to act as a default value of an object

   Observer pattern: a.k.a. Publish/Subscribe or Event Listener. Objects register to observe an event that may be raised by another object

   Weak reference pattern: De-couple an observer from an observable

   Protocol stack: Communications are handled by multiple layers, which form an encapsulation hierarchy

   Scheduled-task pattern: A task is scheduled to be performed at a particular interval or clock time (used in real-time computing)

   Single-serving visitor pattern: Optimise the implementation of a visitor that is allocated, used only once, and then deleted

   Specification pattern: Recombinable business logic in a boolean fashion

   State pattern: A clean way for an object to partially change its type at runtime

   Strategy pattern: Algorithms can be selected on the fly, using composition

   Template method pattern: Describes the program skeleton of a program; algorithms can be selected on the fly, using inheritance
   
   Visitor pattern: A way to separate an algorithm from an object
