## Behavioral Patterns
   In software engineering, behavioral design patterns are design patterns that identify common communication patterns among objects and realize these patterns. By doing so, these patterns increase flexibility in carrying out this communication.

   Examples of this type of design pattern include:

   Blackboard design pattern: provides a computational framework for the design and implementation of systems that integrate large and diverse specialized modules, and implement complex, non-deterministic control strategies

   Chain of responsibility pattern: Command objects are handled or passed on to other objects by logic-containing processing objects
   Command pattern: Command objects encapsulate an action and its parameters

   "Externalize the stack": Turn a recursive function into an iterative one that uses a stack

   Interpreter pattern: Implement a specialized computer language to rapidly solve a specific set of problems

   Iterator pattern: Iterators are used to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation

   Mediator pattern: Provides a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem

   Memento pattern: Provides the ability to restore an object to its previous state (rollback)

   Null object pattern: Designed to act as a default value of an object

   Observer pattern: a.k.a. Publish/Subscribe or Event Listener. Objects register to observe an event that may be raised by another object

   Weak reference pattern: De-couple an observer from an observable

   Protocol stack: Communications are handled by multiple layers, which form an encapsulation hierarchy

   Scheduled-task pattern: A task is scheduled to be performed at a particular interval or clock time (used in real-time computing)

   Single-serving visitor pattern: Optimise the implementation of a visitor that is allocated, used only once, and then deleted

   Specification pattern: Recombinable business logic in a boolean fashion

   State pattern: A clean way for an object to partially change its type at runtime

   Strategy pattern: Algorithms can be selected on the fly, using composition

   Template method pattern: Describes the program skeleton of a program; algorithms can be selected on the fly, using inheritance
   
   Visitor pattern: A way to separate an algorithm from an object
